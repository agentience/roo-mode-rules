## Decision

* [2025-04-28 15:13:30] - Refactored copy_roo.sh to JavaScript (scripts/copy_roo.js) while adding .roomodes file merging functionality.

## Rationale

* [2025-04-28 15:13:45] - JavaScript implementation provides better maintainability, error handling, and cross-platform compatibility compared to shell scripts. The added .roomodes merging functionality allows for preserving custom modes when copying the .roo directory to other projects.

## Implementation Details

* [2025-04-28 15:14:00] - Created scripts/copy_roo.js that replicates the functionality of copy_roo.sh with added .roomodes merging logic. The script:
  1. Copies the .roo directory to the target directory
  2. Handles .roomodes file:
     - If target doesn't have .roomodes, copies the source file
     - If target has .roomodes, merges custom modes by checking for unique slugs
  3. Added a new npm script "copy-roo-js" in package.json while keeping the original shell script
