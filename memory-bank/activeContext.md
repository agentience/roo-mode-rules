## Current Focus

* [2025-04-28 15:13:20] - Refactoring shell scripts to JavaScript for better maintainability and enhanced functionality. Implemented scripts/copy_roo.js with .roomodes file merging capability.
* [2025-04-28 16:39:00] - Enhancing orchestrator mode task delegation with MCP server relevance determination capabilities.
* [2025-04-28 17:28:20] - Creating specialized modes for specific development tasks, starting with frontend-code mode for React, TypeScript, and Cloudscape development.
* [2025-05-01 12:20:05] - Improving the `copy_roo.js` script by updating the structure of `copy_history.json` to be more efficient and maintainable.

## Recent Changes

* [2025-04-28 15:56:40] - Initialized git repository, created README.md with documentation on how to use npm scripts to bootstrap other projects, added MIT LICENSE, and pushed to GitHub repository at git@github.com:agentience/roo-mode-rules.git.
* [2025-04-28 16:08:30] - Changed project license from MIT to Apache License 2.0 to comply with the upstream repository (roo-code-memory-bank). Updated all relevant files with appropriate license headers and created a NOTICE file.
* [2025-04-28 16:38:00] - Created mcp-server-relevance.roo.yaml with guidelines for orchestrator mode to dynamically determine relevant MCP servers for subtasks. Added the file to the orchestrator mode's context in mode-rule-context.yaml.
* [2025-04-28 17:28:00] - Created frontend-code mode with specialized rules for React, TypeScript, and Cloudscape development. Added the mode to .roomodes, mode-rule-context.yaml, mode-capabilities.roo.yaml, and task-delegation-patterns.roo.yaml.
* [2025-05-01 12:22:33] - Completed the `copy_history.json` update task, changing the structure from an array to an object keyed by targetDirectory. Created migration script and updated the copy script to work with the new structure.

## Open Questions/Issues

* [2025-04-28 17:28:40] - Should we create additional specialized modes for other development tasks, such as backend-code, mobile-code, or infrastructure-code?
